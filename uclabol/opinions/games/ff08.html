<p>
The key element in FF8 is the effect, or burden of past history.  
The supposed love between Squall (here upon referred to as SQ) 
and Rinoa (here upon referred to as RI) is an attempt at 
fufillment of innocent desire from a generation ago.  Before 
I go on to establish this claim, I'd like to stress that 
it matters not what Square Soft "wants" us to see.  The important 
thing is what is there in the game/story.
<p>
For those of you who missed it, SQ's father is Laguna.  
Evidence: First, the blood of SQ tastes like Laguna's, so the 
moombas call SQ Laguna when they rescue him from the prison.  
Second, Laguna has SQ's card.  Third, and most obvious, Kiros says 
that "it's a good thing [SQ] doesn't look like [his] father," but 
that he does look like his mother.  On the other hand, as Kiros 
tells us during his visit with Laguna, RI's mother is Julia, 
since her father is General Carraway.
<p>
The game tells us, through quite subtle hints, that SQ's father 
once loved RI's mother, but that each of them (Laguna and Julia) 
ended up marrying someone else.  We get the sense, however, 
that Laguna really DOES love Raine, the person he ended up 
"settling down" with.  Although Julia's history was mentioned 
only briefly during Kiro's visit when Laguna served as the "village 
patrol", it would be injudicious for us to say that Julia did not 
love General Carraway.  Here, then, is the key to the relationships 
in the story.  What we are seeing in SQ and RI is a historical 
fulfillment of past love.  SQ does what Laguna couldn't do and 
RI does what Julia couldn't do.  The son and daughter unite, after 
a generation of lost love (for their parents).  But this is only 
the beginning of the story.  Because Laguna and Julia each eventually 
settled down with a second love (with a kind of calmness instead 
of passion, after those innocent and childish pursuits), we suspect 
that time would pass for SQ and RI as well, and that events would 
occur... until one day, this childish love between Laguna and 
Julia (remember, they met at a bar, with him star-gazing like 
a kid who's been reading National Enquirer about some new-formed 
starlet), resurrected in SQ and RI, would pass into history.
<p>
If we take this message as a given (and it is undeniable that the 
message is there, however subtle Square has tried to make it), 
there are numerous attributes in Rinoa's character that serves 
to provide an understanding about both Julia and Laguana 
(who is, btw, the most interesting character in the game).  
First, Rinoa is one of two sorceresses remaining in the world.  
How did <i>that</i> happen?  Was it inherited from her mother?  
Or did something horrific happed?  Supposedly (and I'm spoiling 
for you big time if you haven't finished the game) Ultimecia 
invaded Edea's body, then switched over to Rinoa, tending to 
her "knight" Seifer.  (RI and Seifer were supposed to be old 
couples, though we aren't really sure if that wasn't Ultimecia's 
power working on an earlier RI; we never get to see it in the game.)  
But Ultimecia wouldn't want to use RI if she <i>wasn't</i> 
a sorceress in the first place.  For those of you who has seen 
the ending, you know where Edea's power comes from (from the 
defeated Ultimecia herself).  But where does RI's power come from?  
Sorcery can't just <i>happen</i>.  Note that RI was always left out 
of the group of characters, who were all brought up on Edea's garden.  
Unlike the other characters who were fighting, in part, for Matron, 
RI had little to fight for.  She really wasn't the type that 
sacrificed herself to the world.  But who was she?  How did she 
become a sorceress?  Is RI simply the symbol of a primitive power, 
as eloquently stated in the myth of the creation of the world 
told by the white seeds to the orphan children on board?  No, 
there must be a better explanation.
<p>
But we can't find one.  At least I can't find one. It appears 
that RI's power is one of Square's version of Hitchcock's MacGuffin 
(see <i>Hitchock</i>, by Truffaut, especially the section on 
<i>Notorious</i>).  Neither do we know much about her mother, 
except that her song shows up in strange yet relevant places in the 
game.  Perhaps Square didn't want to crank out a fifth disk that 
illustrates RI and Julia's side of the story.  If such is the case, 
the original story must be sitting somewhere in the Square vaults 
and we have no access to the threads that would unravel the mystery.  
Given all this, we can only guess at what the original vision 
could have been.  There are a few clues in the game that serves 
to refine our conjectures.  The next paragraph talks about very 
subtle ideas in the game that are missed by most players, but are 
crucial to an understanding of Final Fantasy 8.  If you haven't 
played it in a while, I suggest seeing the ending and final fight 
once more.
<p>
First, note that Ultimecia's GF is Griever, Squall's "pet" lion 
drawing.  Ultimecia drops in on Edea's garden during the game's 
ending, giving Edea her power.  This, I suppose is how Edea, and 
hence SQ remembers Griever, who just happens to coincide with SQ's 
ambitions.  It is certainly strange to have one of the final 
bosses to share the name of the main character's ring and pet sketch. 
Now, notice that Griever's name is first mentioned when RI visits 
SQ's single.  It is mentioned again during the battle of the gardens, 
right before the entrance into the dungeon containing cerberus, 
Seifer, and Edea.  For some reason, RI <i>wants</i> SQ's ring. 
She even asks Zell to borrow it from SQ and Zell promises to make 
one for her just like it (She seems to want the original, though).  
Here is the (subtle) link I've been promising.  RI desires a 
symbol of Ultimecia's GF.  And this is <i>before</i> she was 
possessed by Ultimecia!  RI, then, is linked to the sorcery that 
surrounds the game, may be even a part of it (as suggested in the 
next paragraph).  (On a side note, I wonder if RI would have been 
saved in space if she had not worn that mysterious ring of Griever.  
Do we really think SQ just happened to land on her in the multitude 
of space like that?  It is something strange and remarkable that 
keeps RI alive: Griever, Ultimecia's GF.)  Here's more evidence.  
Remember the beginning intro?  "I am here", the voice suggests, 
"waiting..."; it appears that it was RI talking.  She was talking 
to SQ, perhaps in his dream, may be even tempting him.  In fact, 
up to and including the scene where she releases Adel, we can't be 
sure whether RI loves SQ at all.  Here's a girl who had a suspicious 
affair with Seifer, who criticizes the way of life of SQ, and who 
ends up performing the only real evil act in the game (releasing Adel), 
though she was "possessed" by a higher power.  The game-player 
was seeing the story from SQ's point of view; and SQ was clearly 
fascinated by her.  But was she fascinated by him, or really by his 
Griever?  In any case, she is a sorceress.  You don't become a 
sorceress in a day.  She must have been "carrying it around" for 
years.  And then, she met SQ, ie. the man with Griever (even his name 
is identified with the lion Griever; his father's name is Loire, 
but he is named after what seems to be Lion-Heart, that is Leonhart).  
And she fell <i>into</i> love.
<p>
But of course, the main female character in the game can't be evil, 
even though, as we know, all the playable characters were from a 
common beginning: Edea's nursery, except, of course, RI.  
(She is rather strange, isn't she?)  When we look at the symbolism 
in the game, she is triumphantly good: an angel with a pair of 
wings (although we can also suggest that she is a witch with a 
dog).  All the other characters were "seeds" grown on Edea's 
garden (SQ was a seed that grew into a "lion").  Only RI is an "angel" 
who was also a sorceress (poking fun at or criticizing religion?).  
The symbols extends to the white cross versus the black cross, 
good versus evil, etc.  But I thought Final Fantasy 8 was about 
love?  Yes, it is about love, but not necessary lover's love.  
Perhaps both RI and Matron are good in reference to their love 
for peace: Matron brings up seeds to conquer the evil, RI despises 
fighting.  This line of argument hits a brick wall when we realize 
that RI's distaste for fighting parallels Ultimecia's dislike of 
fighting (she likes to control others instead).  In fact, Matron's 
care for her seeds can be seen in Ultimecia's final form as well, 
when, during the final battle, she "lectures" to her children as 
in the the <i>liberti fatali</i>, reproduced here:
<ul>
Arise from your sleep, my children<br>
Your cradles shall no longer exist.<br>
Arise from your sleep, Children of Fate.<br>
Abandon your cradles.<br>
Arise.<br>
Discover the Garden of Truth.<br>
Brilliant truth.<br>
Burn the evil of the world.<br>
Burning truth<br>
Set ablaze the realms of darkness<br>
Prevail, children,<br>
Fated day.<br>
</ul>
Well, if this game is about maternal love, it is a very pessimistic 
portrayal of it indeed.  The "Garden of Truth" can be said to be 
the evil realities of the world, where love, presumably does not 
exist, and innocence is lost.  Just as maternal love is corrupted 
for the children of Edea, the love between SQ and RI is also 
corrupted.  Innocence is lost, perfect passionate love is forgotten, 
and the seething realities of the world creep in.  Remember that 
Laguna looked toward Raine's grave with a faint smile.  What could 
he be thinking about?  Certainly not Julia.  He is not regretting, 
but contemplating on how realities set in.  His long journeys 
did eventually come to an end.  His exciting adventures led to 
years of work as a president working on space shuttles.  He regretted 
not visiting Raine on his death.  But really, his life is no 
longer dynamic.  He is living out his days statically.  He can 
only remember the past.  Surely, this type of future awaits SQ 
and RI as well.  Boy, is this the education Square is hinting at?
<p>
Before we attempt a resolution on the problem of RI's characterization 
and what good a sorceress can do, let's go back to a missing 
link in the story: Ellone.  If RI's past is a MacGuffen, then Elone's 
power is a MacGuffen upon a MacGuffen.  All we can gather from the 
game is that Ellone was neither Laguna <i>nor</i> Raine's daughter.  
She was raised by Raine when her parents were killed early in her 
life.  Perhaps the most blatant confirmation of love is Laguna's 
rescue of Ellone.  Not only was Ellone important to the world, she 
was important to Laguna is a very special way.  Here's a man who 
has been through the trivialities of childish, star-gazing love, 
the excitement of adventure and war, and who becomes so wise by 
experience that even the moombas hail him.  But then he forgot about 
Ellone and Raine and love and worked in Esthar to create his Utopia.  
When he looks back, he doesn't regret a thing.  He has grown up.  
Laguna is the fullest character in the game because we see his entire 
history.  In contrast, RI is whimsical, unpredictable, erratic, and 
hence, inhuman.  By comparing Ellone with RI, we see that RI is 
much more powerful, yet less crucial.  Both seem to be instruments 
of warfare.  Both are sociable.  RI, however, is introverted 
despite her apparence.  This brings us to a final point about RI 
before we close on a resolution.
<p>
The lost of memory is a key part of the game.  This is presumably 
due to the character's use of GFs.  (In fact, SQ must have used 
GFs so much that he forgets who his sister is and what she's like, 
except in certain moments in his dreams.)  Yet, RI has never used 
GFs up to SQ's contact with her.  Unlike all the other characters, 
RI should have her memory completely intact.  Yet she never <i>ever</i> 
talks about her past.  Even recent events in the recent past are 
held back.  We know this because SQ learns about RI just before the 
space rescue when Ellone takes him into her mind.  Apparently, he 
didn't konw about her harangue with Irvine, her request to Zell 
for SQ's ring, etc.  In fact, Ellone was relunctant about diving 
into RI's memory (she was the only person Ellone had trouble 
diving into).  Thus RI is secretive.  She tells nobody about her 
relationship with Seifert.  Up to the end of the ending, she hasn't 
confessed a single event in her relationship with that Sorceress's 
knight.  During Edea's parade/confrontation, she tells nobody about 
her plans to put Dr. Odine's bracelet on Edea.  She appears to be 
a sort of bridge between SQ's "white feather" goodness and Seifert's 
"black cross" contemptuousness.  She is neither moral nor immoral.  
She can play with a stranger in a ball room ("You will like me... 
you will like me..."), fall in love with a villian, and breath life 
into a hero.  Yet inspite of what the dialog suggests, she is the 
most introspective of all the characters.  We never get to hear a 
single word about her past.  Yet she never complains about not being 
able to remember anything.  She is a sort of be-witching charm 
that hooks SQ.  He is not so much in love as in fascination.  
The game-player is also fascinated by her grace, unpredictability, 
and childish behavior.  She is also the most attractive yet most 
whimsical character in the game.  Is this idea of a female companion?  
Who is she?  We don't know.  Why is she here?  We don't know.  
What will she become?  We don't know.
<p>
Here, then is the final interpretation (solution) that I've gathered.  
RI must be linked with Ultimecia in some deeper, non-superficial 
way, hence this infatuation with Griever, and with Seifer.  
Some might suggest that RI IS Ultimecia, but I wouldn't go 
<i>that</i> far.  The story has no support for it.  I do think, 
however, that what is missing from the story (locked up in Square's 
project files) is the <i>relationship</i> between Ultimecia and RI.  
Is she really Julia's daughter?  Or did something happen in between?  
In spite of all this, there is a clear change in tone in the story 
after the escapade on the moon.  The message I got out of it was 
that due to SQ's bravery and persistence, RI was saved, and that RI 
was now <i>truely</i> in love.  From here on, they promise to meet 
at Edea's garden if anything should separate them.  Thus, even when 
SQ was stuck, infatuated with his childhood and with Ultimecia's Edea, 
in the time capsule, RI comes back to fetch him, etc, etc... happy 
ending.  But of course, we never see what happens afterward.  
Did they split up just as SQ's father and RI's mother did?  Did 
history repeat itself, or was it really a new beginning?  We can't 
tell, of course.  But some of us are shouting for a sequel...  
which will never happen, because this fantasy was supposed to be 
a final fantasy.
