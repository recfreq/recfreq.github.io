<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Annotation and revision are 
integral parts of the writing process. Authors of documents almost always need 
to send drafts to others for comments, assessment, and editing. The key to 
success in all of these tasks is collaboration. Authors need an intuitive, 
timesaving means for annotation, revision, and collaboration on electronic 
documents.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The current process 
involves authors creating documents electronically, printing them to pass on to 
reviewers, and then receiving a jumble of marked up printouts from these 
reviewers.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Authors then must first 
decide which revisions to accept and then must manually fold in each change into 
the electronic original. This process, especially when multiple reviewers are 
involved, can quickly become tedious and error-prone.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The Red Ink document system aims 
to resolve the above problems by means of a unique pen-based interface. This 
interface provides a more natural means for annotation, revision, and 
collaboration on electronic documents.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Red Ink is designed for use by both authors and their reviewers, and 
provides a single environment in which these users can transparently exchange 
information.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Reviewers can provide 
feedback directly on the electronic document using pre-defined pen 
gestures.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Such feedback will then 
be available to the author, who can fuse desired changes into the final document 
using a similar set of gestures.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The entire system is implemented in Java, thereby allowing a degree of 
portability not available with other possible underlying implementations.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Furthermore, the system is designed with 
tablet PCs in mind, which will likely be in widespread use in coming years.</P>

<H3>Easy Task</H3>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">To utilize Red Ink, users must 
choose a document for others to revise. This process involves logging into the 
system, creating a new account if necessary, going to the proper tab, importing 
a document to be revised, and adding reviewers to receive the document.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The easy task was chosen to ensure 
that users are comfortable with basic file management UIs. During user testing 
and heuristic evaluation, the easy task was a pre-requisite for the more 
advanced features. It also demonstrated the basic idea of our application: to 
allow authors and reviewers to transparently exchange information.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></P>
<H3>Moderate Task</H3>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">As a reviewer, users can revise 
and annotate documents by using appropriate gestures. This process involves 
opening up a document in the proper tab, reading it carefully, editing it using 
the “insert”, “strikeout”, “select”, and other gestures, commenting on it using 
the comment gesture, and typing in the insertions or comments.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The moderate task was an 
introduction to the gesture-based interface system. It demonstrated the 
feasibility pen-based input for emulating the experience of editing documents 
naturally. More importantly, it showed us, for the first time, whether users 
could understand how gesture-based interaction works. This task demonstrates the 
recognition-based engine driving the interface.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></P>
<H3>Difficult Task</H3>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">As the author, the user can 
incorporate changes made by other reviewers. This process involves opening a 
document in the proper tab, accepting or rejecting changes made by reviewers 
using gestures, and adding any additional annotations.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The difficult task was designed to 
test the user's ability to use advanced gestures that were designed to interact 
with other pre-made annotations as opposed to the text itself. This task is 
difficult because users are asked to understand the way the “accept” and 
“reject” gestures work in their relationship to the seemingly unrelated set of 
annotations seen on the screen. Thus, the difficult task tests whether our 
interface is as intuitive as paper and pencil.</P>

network components such as publishing, and gesture-based document

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>This monolithic 
interface allowed annotation of other users’ documents, sending out documents to 
be revised, and editing documents in general.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Furthermore, this interface never 
clarified whether annotations would be collaborative in the “real-time” 
sense.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>We decided against a 
real-time system since revision is not currently a real time process and also 
because real time interaction did not grant anything significant to the 
task.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In addition, we realized that 
a more conventional document management interface was necessary since allowing 
document management within the context of a pen based interface is somewhat 
confusing.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Lastly, we also had not 
decided whether the interface would be a stand-alone application or part of a 
Web application.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Upon design of our 
low-fi prototype, we realized that the interface needed to be a stand-alone 
application, since web applications are quite limited in their 
functionality.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">These design decisions required us 
to break up the application into 2 primary sections: the document management 
section and the gesture based annotation section. A login screen leads the user 
into the document management window.<!--[if gte vml 1]> <v:shape id=_x0000_i1026

<P class=MsoNormal>Here the user can view the properties of the different

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">We found two primary difficulties 
during the low-fi testing. The first was not related to the design of the 
interface, but rather it was the lack of feedback of a paper prototype; the 
second was the unfamiliarity users had with using a gesture-based 
interface.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Although the low-fi 
interface presented the user with an experience similar to the process of 
revising a document on paper, using a pen to make gestures on top of a 
transparency remained very unnatural.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>Due to the lack of useful feedback during the user testing, the gestures 
and annotation pane interface remained largely unchanged between the low-fi and 
interactive prototypes.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Since the 
interactive prototype was stand-alone, we employed Wizard of Oz techniques to 
fake the behavior of the gesture recognition.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal>We did gain some very useful information regarding the 
document management interface. This interface contained a large number of 
buttons, and through this phase of user testing, we found that the large volume 
of buttons confused the user. To rectify this problem, we provided a much 
simpler alternative in the first interactive prototype.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Between these two prototypes, we 
conducted a pilot usability test to find any other design problems with the Red 
Ink system. This test was a bit premature since we had not completely fleshed 
out the interface, but it still provided us with some good feedback. We found 
that the users still had a bit of difficulty switching into the paper-based user 
model using gestures for interaction instead of toolbars. To ease the user into 
the interface, we included a tutorial when she signed up as a new user and also 
implemented the help feature in the annotation pane.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">We also found that the user did 
not always perform the gestures properly and was confused since not all of the 
gestures on the left pane were implemented. To clear the confusion, we grayed 
out the gestures not implemented and placed thick dots at the critical points in 
the gesture. We found that the user easily got frustrated when she was trying to 
do something that she thought was correct but the machine was misunderstanding. 
To solve this problem, we added a status window displaying the interpretations 
of the machine. This window also allowed us to display the content of comments 
and insertions. </P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">In addition, we cleaned up the 
gesture recognition so that tapping is now ignored and included features that we 
did not have the time to implement before such as the multi-level undo, the 
button bar at the bottom, and buttons for future features in the comment window 
(ie. audio annotation). Lastly, we cleaned up some of the document management 
panes by re-labeling the “Edit Reviewers” button as “Send to Reviewers”, making 
the corresponding pane more intuitive, converting the add document dialog into a 
more standard form, and making the button arrangement more aesthetic.</P>

document and visually view the annotations made. There are also a few other 
tools such as a search, help, and exit. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The “Documents To Revise” section

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">If the View/Annotate button is 
pressed from the “Documents To Revise” Pane, the reviser’s version of the 
annotation pane is seen. Here, the essay to be revised occupies the center of 
the screen, a help pane describing the possible gestures occupies the left and 
the button bar and status window occupy up the bottom of the screen. The 
interaction scheme aims to be more natural than current solutions, and so the 
interface is directly modeled after paper-based revising. The user is expected 
to treat the window as a piece of paper, and so she makes gestures on the 
document itself.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>These gestures are all interpreted by the computer and feedback on the 
interpretation of the gesture is immediately returned when the computer redraws 
the stroke. The user uses the left help pane as a guide to what gestures are 
recognized by the system, and how to properly draw them; the thick dots on each 
gesture are designed to give the user a guide as to what critical points the 
gesture interpreter is looking for. All of the implemented gestures are 
highlighted in blue and the unimplemented ones are grayed out. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN

</SPAN>In brief, the reviser sees that someone has sent her a document when it 
is listed in the document to revise pane. The user selects the document, clicks 
on view/annotate and the annotation pane pops up; then the user revises the 
document in a similar fashion as she would with paper. She makes gestures on the 
document itself using the help pane on the left as a guide to the gestures, and 
once she is finished, she clicks on done. </P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN

</SPAN>However, gesture recognition is not always perfect and errors do occur on 
part of the computer and the human. To account for this possibility, we have 
implemented a “multiple event undo” button on the button bar. This will grant 
the user the flexibility to remove an annotation or string of annotations 
previously made. In addition, we have included a status window at the bottom of 
the screen to give the user a glimpse into the interpretations of the 
computer.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This feature is necessary 
so that the behavior of the computer does not seem as mystical and the user has 
more input as to why an error occurred. We hope that this window will ease user 
frustration if the system does not operate optimally. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN 
style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The gestures we are using are modeled after the gestures we saw being 
used in the contextual inquiry stage. We wanted to make the gestures in our 
system similar so that they would be intuitive to the user. However, due to the 
limitations of the gesture recognition technology, we could not implement the 
gestures exactly. The technology required all of the gestures to be single 
strokes as opposed to multiple strokes, and it also required that the gestures 
be quite distinct from one another. </P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">It is important to note that the 
insert and comment gestures are a little different than the other gestures. 
These two gestures require a pop-up window in addition to the gesture itself. So 
upon insert, for instance, one must place a carrot where an insertion is desired 
and then a window will pop-up asking for input of the content to be inserted. 
Right now, text input is all that is implemented, although we have provided the 
buttons for other desired features such as audio annotation and free hand text. 
Once this is complete, the user can tap on the insertion icon and the content of 
the insertion will be displayed in the status window.</P>

almost identical to the reviewer’s view; the main difference is in the task 
being carried out. In the reviewer’s view, the task is to revise the document, 
whereas in this screen, the task is to accept or reject changes made by other 
reviewers.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN

centered in the box to respectively accept or reject a given revision. If the 
revision is accepted, than it is automatically folded in, ie. If the user 
accepts a strikeout then that piece of text is deleted. If the revision is 
rejected, then the revision mark is erased from the document.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Several of our initial design 
plans were left off of our final prototype due to time and technology 
constraints.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In our initial design, 
we had focused our attention upon the actual content annotation, such as being 
able to mark up images, video, as well as regular text in a rather sophisticated 
manner.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Firstly, we realized that 
this would be overwhelming to use for users; secondly, implementing such 
features would not truly address usability issues, but rather mere 
time-consuming technology ones.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>For 
this reason, features such as audio annotations, while convenient for the user, 
are not fundamental in our interface design and thus have been omitted.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Other features we planned have 
been omitted because they would only serve to confuse the user unless completely 
implemented.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>For example, all of 
our prototypes, both lo-fi and hi-fi have included a document view slider.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This slider was made to allow switching 
between summary view and document view.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>The intent was that the user could view a summary of all the annotations 
and revisions made to a document at a glance without going through the document 
to find all the individual marks made.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>However, since in all of our prototypes, the features has been 
unimplemented, users have had no idea what it does, and for some reason were 
always compelled to attempt to use it in vain. Furthermore, we found that a 
slider would not be the right widget for this purpose, since a slider usually 
implies the use of multiple intermediate modes, whereas our summary/document 
view is more bi-modal.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">One feature that we have not 
implemented is managing the revisions of multiple reviewers. Although this 
feature is quite important to the task and we did demonstrate it in the first 
interactive prototype, we did not have the time to implement it.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Other superfluous features such as 
signature recognition for login have been left off since they do not 
significantly affect the user experience in either a positive or negative way. 
Also, since we are focusing in on the interactions, we displayed the save button 
but did not choose to implement it.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Finally, as expected, the system 
does not implement backend network connectivity and a user database.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This does not affect the interface, but 
it causes the search and save features to be non-functional, and in addition, 
the “Documents You’ve Written” tab and “Documents To Revise” tab do not 
accurately reflect documents as if they had been written by the user or sent to 
them by a peer.</P>

to use and fairly productive. The Swing documentation was comprehensive and 
mostly comprehensible. We used the Forte for Java CE 1.0 development environment 
to manage our projects. It was easy to learn but difficult to customize. Satin 
Version 2.2 and Quill were used to make our gesture sets and interpret gestures 
based on the set we made. Quill had a easy to use and efficient interface. We 
used Satin only for one specific task of providing us with a ranking of possible 
gestures. We chose Swing, Satin, and Quill because they allowed us to move from 
basic gesture sets to a full-fledged interface without having to learn another 
programming language. Java was the programming language of choice because of its 
simplicity and universality.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">The Swing package is enormous. It 
is difficult for the ordinary programmer to keep track of its entire set of 
relevant interface components. Hence we relied on Forte for much of the GUI 
level development. Unfortunately, Forte is tedious for managing multiple 
projects. It is also difficult to customize and has a steep learning curve. For 
example, Forte does not allow us to delete certain code. If we delete code using 
another application, Forte regenerates it unless we delete the form as well. It 
also took a long time to simply set up our programming environments because of 
the rigidity of Forte. Forte has poorly designed efficiency features such as a 
limited set of customizable short cuts. Satin is large and complicated. Hence we 
only used what was absolutely necessary to our GUI: Sheet and RubineInterpreter. 
Some of the arguments to functions in Satin are not very intuitive. Quill was a 
bit too simple - we had hoped to create multiple-stroke gestures, but quill will 
not work optimally if we had.</P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
