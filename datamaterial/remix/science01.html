<div id="div2">
The science of forgetting is not inscrutable;<br>
so much information pokes at our brain<br>
for attention that to forget it is forgivable.
</div>
<div id="div3">
Making forgetting a routine is an insightful<br>
way to absorb rejection and deal with pain.<br>
The science of forgetting is not inscrutable.
</div>
<div id="div4">
Forget old colleagues' names that aren't so useful;<br>
omit trained habits to learn new ones instead.<br>
Just archive your indices. Tis all forgivable.
</div>
<div id="div5">
I can forget meetings, failures, disputes; capable<br>
of conditioning my mind daily to remain sane.<br>
The science of forgetting is not inscrutable.	
</div>
<div id="div6">
I blank out on my age, name, and every syllable<br>
I uttered (Emphatic!) to make my existence remain.<br>
It moved on before me, but even that's forgivable.
</div>
<div id="div7">
But when you (whose voice moves me, face bespectacle)<br>
left me my memories, I give but one refrain:<br>
the science of forgetting is not inscrutable<br>
but being forgotten, that is
</div>
<div id="div8">
unforgivable.
