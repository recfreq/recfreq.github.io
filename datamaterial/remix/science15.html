<div class="line1">The science of forgetting is not inscrutable;
<div class="line9"><div class="line2">so much information pokes at our brain
<div class="line8"><div class="line3">for attention that to forget it is forgivable.<p>

<div class="line7"><div class="line4">Making forgetting a routine is an insightful
<div class="line6"><div class="line5">way to absorb rejection and deal with pain.</div>
The science of forgetting is not inscrutable.</div></div><br>

Forget old colleagues' names that aren't so useful;</div></div>
omit trained habits to learn new ones instead.</div></div>
Just archive your indices. Tis all forgivable.</div></div><p>

<div class="line1">I can forget meetings, failures, disputes; capable
<div class="line9"><div class="line2">of conditioning my mind daily to remain sane.
<div class="line8"><div class="line3">The science of forgetting is not inscrutable.<p>

<div class="line7"><div class="line4">I blank out on my age, name, and every syllable
<div class="line6"><div class="line5">I uttered (Emphatic!) to make my existence remain.</div>
It moved on before me, but even that's forgivable.</div></div><br>

But when you (whose voice moves me, face bespectacle)</div></div>
left me my memories, I give but one refrain:</div></div>
the science of forgetting is not inscrutable<br>
but being forgotten, that is unforgivable.</div></div>
