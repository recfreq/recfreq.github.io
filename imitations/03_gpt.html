<div id="orig"><p>
You do not do, you do not do<br>
Any more, black shoe<br>
In which I have lived like a foot<br>
For thirty years, poor and white,<br>
Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.
</p><p>
Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br>
You died before I had time-<br>
Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,<br>
Ghastly statue with one gray toe<br>
Big as a Frisco seal
</p><p>
And a head in the freakish Atlantic<br>
Where it pours bean green over blue<br>
In the waters off beautiful Nauset.<br>
I used to pray to recover you.<br>
Ach, du.
</p><p>
In the German tongue, in the Polish town<br>
Scraped flat by the roller<br>
Of wars, wars, wars.<br>
But the name of the town is common.<br>
My Polack friend
</p><p>
Says there are a dozen or two.<br>
So I never could tell where you<br>
Put your foot, your root,<br>
I never could talk to you.<br>
The tongue stuck in my jaw.
</p><p>
It stuck in a barb wire snare.<br>
Ich, ich, ich, ich,<br>
I could hardly speak.<br>
I thought every German was you.<br>
And the language obscene
</p><p>
An engine, an engine<br>
Chuffing me off like a Jew.<br>
A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.<br>
I began to talk like a Jew.<br>
I think I may well be a Jew.
</p><p>
The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna<br>
Are not very pure or true.<br>
With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck<br>
And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack<br>
I may be a bit of a Jew.
</p><p>
I have always been scared of you,<br>
With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.<br>
And your neat mustache<br>
And your Aryan eye, bright blue.<br>
Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You-
</p><p>
Not God but a swastika<br>
So black no sky could squeak through.<br>
Every woman adores a Fascist,<br>
The boot in the face, the brute<br>
Brute heart of a brute like you.
</p><p>
You stand at the blackboard, daddy,<br>
In the picture I have of you,<br>
A cleft in your chin instead of your foot<br>
But no less a devil for that, no not<br>
Any less the black man who
</p><p>
Bit my pretty red heart in two.<br>
I was ten when they buried you.<br>
At twenty I tried to die<br>
And get back, back, back to you.<br>
I thought even the bones would do.
</p><p>
But they pulled me out of the sack,<br>
And they stuck me together with glue.<br>
And then I knew what to do.<br>
I made a model of you,<br>
A man in black with a Meinkampf look
</p><p>
And a love of the rack and the screw.<br>
And I said I do, I do.<br>
So daddy, I'm finally through.<br>
The black telephone's off at the root,<br>
The voices just can't worm through.
</p><p>
If I've killed one man, I've killed two-<br>
The vampire who said he was you<br>
And drank my blood for a year,<br>
Seven years, if you want to know.<br>
Daddy, you can lie back now.
</p><p>
There's a stake in your fat black heart<br>
And the villagers never liked you.<br>
They are dancing and stamping on you.<br>
They always knew it was you.<br>
Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.
