<div id="orig"><p>
You do not do, you do not do<br>
Any more, black shoe<br>
In which I have lived like a foot<br>
For thirty years, poor and white,<br>
Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.
</p><p>
Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br>
You died before I had time-<br>
Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,<br>
Ghastly statue with one gray toe<br>
Big as a Frisco seal
</p><p>
And a head in the freakish Atlantic<br>
Where it pours bean green over blue<br>
In the waters off beautiful Nauset.<br>
I used to pray to recover you.<br>
Ach, du.
</p><p>
In the German tongue, in the Polish town<br>
Scraped flat by the roller<br>
Of wars, wars, wars.<br>
But the name of the town is common.<br>
My Polack friend
</p><p>
Says there are a dozen or two.<br>
So I never could tell where you<br>
Put your foot, your root,<br>
I never could talk to you.<br>
The tongue stuck in my jaw.
</p><p>
It stuck in a barb wire snare.<br>
Ich, ich, ich, ich,<br>
I could hardly speak.<br>
I thought every German was you.<br>
And the language obscene
</p><p>
An engine, an engine<br>
Chuffing me off like a Jew.<br>
A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.<br>
I began to talk like a Jew.<br>
I think I may well be a Jew.
</p><p>
The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna<br>
Are not very pure or true.<br>
With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck<br>
And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack<br>
I may be a bit of a Jew.
</p><p>
I have always been scared of you,<br>
With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.<br>
And your neat mustache<br>
And your Aryan eye, bright blue.<br>
Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You-
</p><p>
Not God but a swastika<br>
So black no sky could squeak through.<br>
Every woman adores a Fascist,<br>
The boot in the face, the brute<br>
Brute heart of a brute like you.
</p><p>
You stand at the blackboard, daddy,<br>
In the picture I have of you,<br>
A cleft in your chin instead of your foot<br>
But no less a devil for that, no not<br>
Any less the black man who
</p><p>
Bit my pretty red heart in two.<br>
I was ten when they buried you.<br>
At twenty I tried to die<br>
And get back, back, back to you.<br>
I thought even the bones would do.
</p><p>
But they pulled me out of the sack,<br>
And they stuck me together with glue.<br>
And then I knew what to do.<br>
I made a model of you,<br>
A man in black with a Meinkampf look
</p><p>
And a love of the rack and the screw.<br>
And I said I do, I do.<br>
So daddy, I'm finally through.<br>
The black telephone's off at the root,<br>
The voices just can't worm through.
</p><p>
If I've killed one man, I've killed two-<br>
The vampire who said he was you<br>
And drank my blood for a year,<br>
Seven years, if you want to know.<br>
Daddy, you can lie back now.
</p><p>
There's a stake in your fat black heart<br>
And the villagers never liked you.<br>
They are dancing and stamping on you.<br>
They always knew it was you.<br>
Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.

<b>You do not do, you do not do<br>
Any more, black shoe<br>
In which I have lived like a foot<br>

</p><p>
Daddy, I have had to kill you.<br>
You've had to kill daddy, I have had to<br>
Kill you, I have had to you.<br>
You died before I had time<br>
Marble-heavy, a bag full of God.
</p><p>
Mommy, I'll write you from prison,<br>
Locked up for taking pictures<br>
Of you ecstatic women sitting on the floor.<br>
The press sat tightly in their boxes<br>
In the Flowernds carpetless Note-In.
</p><p>
In the German tongue, in the Polish town<br>
Cocktail, in the barn, in the cemetery<br>
Full of life and death but one breath<br>
Any more alcohol or wars,<br>
With what sometimes comes back to bite you?
</p><p>
I know another name, too:<br>
The Great German.<br>
It's the strongest language.<br>
And the slowest of all,<br>
The one that can write at a slow blow.
</p><p>
Garage numbers on the Grid,<br>
The tongue of Bickford,<br>
The cutaway Original CT all red,<br>
I have the Metropolis handwriting<br>
On the dash, dash off print.
</p><p>
I tried to kill the blackbird at Brooklyn.<br>
At Aragon, in the narrow beam.<br>
And the blackbirds chirped in and out.<br>
I tried to visit you, see where I may.<br>
And you was not clear.
</p><p>
Or Know-It-I-Called-Me-A-Nazi.<br>
My Grandmother Knows Me Edith,<br>
Of Willing Butts & Party Brutality,<br>
On The Lo Textbook This Year, Beautiful Books,<br>
And Zarathustra Beautiful seas.
</p><p>
I have always been scared of you,<br>
With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.<br>
And your neat mustache<br>
And your Aryan skin, bright blue.<br>
They puffed me until I was fifteen.
</p><p>
And now I see, they hurtle in and out.<br>
An ugly devil is shabby, shabby looking<br>
With lonely folks unemployed with the Arts,<br>
Who See Small Paintings Plottingly Around The Floor,<br>
And Call Me Carolyn.
</p><p>
Every woman is exactly the same.<br>
She loveble meets men in print.<br>
She cut the blood off your foot.<br>
And now I know, you bitch.<br>
I can drink you.
</p><p>
And I, a black man, have only one fate:<br>
Death will do you good,<br>
I, black man, will do nothing but lust after you.<br>
You taught me not to say sorry,<br>
and take responsibility for your mistakes.
</p><p>
Daddy, I will drink you alive;<br>
Even then do I have<br>
An Empire inside you.<br>
I know icy Fountain streets,<br>
Tread thirty knots medicating Havana.
</p><p>
You stood at the blackboard, daddy,<br>
Under the jumping gulping gull-like animal<br>
You sang a song to exhale<br>
The stammer off the blackbird.<br>
The blackbird taught you a language.
</p><p>
It takes only a little bit of heart to tell<br>
It. And when it is gone, it is gone!<br>
It is the breath of life into which I<br>
Walch to dare to step,<br>
Unwanted be yet a bit of a bitch.
</p><p>
It's not fair, it's not even Houston.<br>
To someone of your blood, Asian or Latino,<br>
Trapped between the wars<br>
And the women they abused<br>
And killed don't often see.
