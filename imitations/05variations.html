You can taste it in your noodle<br>
soup, caffeine free, dripping dry from the<br>
ruddy brows of a mother of the Pad. One<br>
imagines it falling from the ladle<br>
fully formed, congealed overnight past<br>
one's bedtime tickling. Tockling.<br>
Toes of small snails are covered<br>
top to bottom with bubbling<br>
patterns of this as it condenses from<br>
thin air in which is seen bright<br>
leaves overlapping each other like Escher<br>
drawing spirals on a<br>
gel. Like gel but solid it makes a<br>
Splash, on my chai in the<br>
dead of winter<br>
tiny sprinkles on a mat as i stoop gazing,<br>
memorizing the scene of Church or<br>
Temple, a wave of Flakes unseen<br>
untouched but touching all it deposits<br>
itself on, including my teacup. But then<br>
it is liquid again precipitate upon<br>
a jug, a gift of many colors for<br>
you to choose, a ribbon of air really<br>
red orange yellow, blue, green etc.<br>
Upload it, download it, put it in a<br>
Cloud.<br>
Listen to it in a Glass<br>
Melody as it forms an ever present<br>
mist. A water is a water is a water.<br>
You have to reach other and<br>
grab it, it is the ultimate nonnegativity,<br>
dripping nonstop, the<br>
nightly lifeline.
</p><p>
And then you start telling someone else<br>
It, not just an exhibition age artist<br>
Trying to provoke a reaction, but really<br>
Really Tell it, splash by splash, sometimes<br>
without saying anything, just to show,<br>
and be guided. Thus<br>
you change that someone, and<br>
Yourself too! And she<br>
Telling it, changes someone<br>
else both creating shaping in their own<br>
image, the face of One<br>
who we see by loving another.<br>
Planting of seeds is a<br>
cycle, It evaporates, rises up,<br>
becomes a net of ideas we cannot forget,<br>
condenses, attains solidity, built<br>
into underbelly foundations of a Taj Mahal<br>
for Eternity to see, coalesces,<br>
even when melted to inspire another to<br>
evaporate, to Tell.<br>
Regardless of percentages it<br>
makes up the world, and no matter what<br>
Mistakes you make, it is there unflinching.<br>
you don't exchange it like bitcoin,<br>
you just give it so the other can drink,<br>
and receive it so the other can dream.<br>
It can be seen reflecting Positivity in a<br>
mirror, for it absorbs hate,<br>
melts it,<br>
makes all the trees green again,<br>
no matter what season,<br>
it brings perpetual<br>
Spring,<br>
touches even one who sits lonely upon a<br>
rock, and when you slap it,<br>
it turns the other cheek, melting it, not just<br>
the mortal body. It giveth and it<br>
washes away, it is part of<br>
everything we are, and it falls to us<br>
drop by drop.
