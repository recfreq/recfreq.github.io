<div id="contents-2"><p></p>
You can taste it in your noodle
<div id="L1">soup, caffeine free, dripping dry from the</div>
ruddy brows of a mother of the Pad. One
<div id="L2">imagines it falling from the ladle</div>
fully formed, congealed overnight past
<div id="L3">one's bedtime tickling. Tockling.</div>
Toes of small snails are covered
<div id="L4">top to bottom with bubbling</div>
patterns of this as it condenses from
<div id="L5">thin air in which is seen bright</div>
leaves overlapping each other like Escher
<div id="L6">drawing spirals on a</div>
gel. Like gel but solid it makes a
<div id="L7">Splash, on my chai in the</div>
dead of winter
<div id="L8">tiny sprinkles on a mat as i stoop gazing,</div>
memorizing the scene of Church or
<div id="L9">Temple, a wave of Flakes unseen</div>
untouched but touching all it deposits
<div id="L10">itself on, including my teacup. But then</div>
it is liquid again precipitate upon
<div id="L11">a jug, a gift of many colors for</div>
you to choose, a ribbon of air really
<div id="L12">red orange yellow, blue, green etc.</div>
Upload it, download it, put it in a
<div id="L13">Cloud.</div>
Listen to it in a Glass
<div id="L14">Melody as it forms an ever present</div>
mist. A water is a water is a water.
<div id="L15">You have to reach other and</div>
grab it, it is the ultimate nonnegativity,
<div id="L16">dripping nonstop, the</div>
nightly lifeline.
</p><p>
And then you start telling someone else<br>
It, not just an exhibition age artist<br>
Trying to provoke a reaction, but really<br>
Really Tell it, splash by splash, sometimes<br>
without saying anything, just to show,<br>
and be guided. Thus<br>
you change that someone, and<br>
Yourself too! And she<br>
Telling it, changes someone<br>
else both creating shaping in their own<br>
image, the face of One<br>
who we see by loving another.<br>
Planting of seeds is a<br>
cycle, It evaporates, rises up,<br>
becomes a net of ideas we cannot forget,<br>
condenses, attains solidity, built<br>
into underbelly foundations of a Taj Mahal<br>
for Eternity to see, coalesces,<br>
even when melted to inspire another to<br>
evaporate, to Tell.<br>
Regardless of percentages it<br>
makes up the world, and no matter what<br>
Mistakes you make, it is there unflinching.<br>
you don't exchange it like bitcoin,<br>
you just give it so the other can drink,<br>
and receive it so the other can dream.<br>
It can be seen reflecting Positivity in a<br>
mirror, for it absorbs hate,<br>
melts it,<br>
makes all the trees green again,<br>
no matter what season,<br>
it brings perpetual<br>
Spring,<br>
touches even one who sits lonely upon a<br>
rock, and when you slap it,<br>
it turns the other cheek, melting it, not just<br>
the mortal body. It giveth and it<br>
washes away, it is part of<br>
everything we are, and it falls to us
<div id="L17">drop by drop.</div>
