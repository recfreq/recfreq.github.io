<div id="contents-2"><p>
I<br>
One hand after the other,<br>
One step over the next along these walls.<br>
A light irradiating from some chamber<br>
Of the mind, a heart pumping from Maria.
</p><p>
II<br>
I hear in blue,<br>
I hear in gold,<br>
I see in green Maria's glow.
</p><p>
III<br>
While all dream of one-sided fractals not one itself<br>
Maria sits and nods.
</p><p>
IV<br>
Print and illustration<br>
Subsume the world.<br>
Print and illustration and identity<br>
Subsume Maria.
</p><p>
V<br>
I do not know whether<br>
I should look inside<br>
The album to read its mind,<br>
Or judge the cover<br>
To feel its heart;<br>
Whether Maria is outside,<br>
Or inside.
</p><p>
VI<br>
A radio blasting against<br>
Trumpets from a statue,<br>
"Long live my ideas!"<br>
Written down and<br>
Deciphered<br>
By Maria,<br>
Silent as a sculpture.
</p><p>
VII<br>
The walls push us in<br>
To look at one side of the mirror,<br>
Each angle a patch of color.<br>
Do you not see the refraction<br>
Of Sorrento, Amsterdam, Dusseldorf<br>
Of the Milky Way?
</p><p>
VIII<br>
I can write greetings<br>
In Hallmark style,<br>
And draw pithy figurines.<br>
I know also Maria is part of<br>
More than I know.
</p><p>
IX<br>
Paint easels, PF Flyers, pillows,<br>
We think we know.<br>
Not Oreos, Ipods, or watches.<br>
They come out of the reflection of<br>
Shards of glass on the wall.
</p><p>
X<br>
As Maria moves from my mind<br>
To yours,<br>
Please listen to the whisper<br>
Without looking.
</p><p>
XI<br>
One after another along those walls.<br>
Where is the issue?<br>
The side-long glances off the prism,<br>
Are light split between you and I and Maria.<br>
What then is heard?
</p><p>
XII<br>
One pillow after another,<br>
The watch stopped ticking.<br>
Infinite time,<br>
Infinite turns,<br>
Infinite shards.<br>
There Maria stands, listening.
