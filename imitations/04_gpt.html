I<br>
Among twenty snowy mountains,<br>
The only moving thing<br>
Was the eye of the blackbird.
</p><p>
II<br>
I was of three minds,<br>
Like a tree<br>
In which there are three blackbirds.
</p><p>
III<br>
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.<br>
It was a small part of the pantomime.
</p><p>
IV<br>
A man and a woman<br>
Are one.<br>
A man and a woman and a blackbird<br>
Are one.
</p><p>
V<br>
I do not know which to prefer,<br>
The beauty of inflections<br>
Or the beauty of innuendoes,<br>
The blackbird whistling<br>
Or just after.
</p><p>
VI<br>
Icicles filled the long window<br>
With barbaric glass.<br>
The shadow of the blackbird<br>
Crossed it, to and fro.<br>
The mood<br>
Traced in the shadow<br>
An indecipherable cause.
</p><p>
VII<br>
O thin men of Haddam,<br>
Why do you imagine golden birds?<br>
Do you not see how the blackbird<br>
Walks around the feet<br>
Of the women about you?
</p><p>
VIII<br>
I know noble accents<br>
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;<br>
But I know, too,<br>
That the blackbird is involved<br>
In what I know.
</p><p>
IX<br>
When the blackbird flew out of sight,<br>
It marked the edge<br>
Of one of many circles.
</p><p>
X<br>
At the sight of blackbirds<br>
Flying in a green light,<br>
Even the bawds of euphony<br>
Would cry out sharply.
</p><p>
XI<br>
He rode over Connecticut<br>
In a glass coach.<br>
Once, a fear pierced him,<br>
In that he mistook<br>
The shadow of his equipage<br>
For blackbirds.
</p><p>
XII<br>
The river is moving.<br>
The blackbird must be flying.
</p><p>
XIII<br>
It was evening all afternoon.<br>
It was snowing<br>
And it was going to snow.<br>
The blackbird sat<br>
In the cedar-limbs.
