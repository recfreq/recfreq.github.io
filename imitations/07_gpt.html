The art of losing isn't hard to master;<br>
so many things seem filled with the intent<br>
to be lost that their loss is no disaster.
</p><p>
Lose something every day. Accept the fluster<br>
of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.<br>
The art of losing isn't hard to master.
</p><p>
Then practice losing farther, losing faster:<br>
places, and names, and where it was you meant<br>
to travel. None of these will bring disaster.
</p><p>
I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or<br>
next-to-last, of three loved houses went.<br>
The art of losing isn't hard to master.
</p><p>
I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,<br>
some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.<br>
I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.
</p><p>
â€”Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture<br>
I love) I shan't have lied. It's evident<br>
the art of losing's not too hard to master<br>
though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.
