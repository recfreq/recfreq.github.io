Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</p><p>
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.
</p><p>
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</p><p>
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.
</p><p>
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
</p><p>
And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

<b>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</b>
</p><p>
Though wise men at their end dream of glorious lightning down from heaven,<br>
do wonder where it comes from, and how it comes to<br>
Please God, it is me who does the wondering.
</p><p>
Good men, too, were wilt thou find it so?<br>
Lose what is lost, and reap what is lost?<br>
Tread thorns to die and live whence they came.
</p><p>
That awful knowledge it brings or cares,<br>
Opportunities, vain imaginings, but find believe by heart's desire,<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.
</p><p>
Grave men, poor souls who were killed in the line of traffic,<br>
But know now, through their sad oversleeping, live up and tell<br>
you what happened. A few miles distant, in the south.
</p><p>
Mozartian genius reigns over the Music of Reality, which<br>
Deciphered my mind's eye to eye stare,<br>
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
