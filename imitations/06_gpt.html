As virtuous men pass mildly away,<br>
And whisper to their souls to go,<br>
Whilst some of their sad friends do say<br>
The breath goes now, and some say, No:
</p><p>
So let us melt, and make no noise,<br>
No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;<br>
'Twere profanation of our joys<br>
To tell the laity our love.
</p><p>
Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears,<br>
Men reckon what it did, and meant;<br>
But trepidation of the spheres,<br>
Though greater far, is innocent.
</p><p>
Dull sublunary lovers' love<br>
(Whose soul is sense) cannot admit<br>
Absence, because it doth remove<br>
Those things which elemented it.
</p><p>
But we by a love so much refined,<br>
That our selves know not what it is,<br>
Inter-assured of the mind,<br>
Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.
</p><p>
Our two souls therefore, which are one,<br>
Though I must go, endure not yet<br>
A breach, but an expansion,<br>
Like gold to airy thinness beat.
</p><p>
If they be two, they are two so<br>
As stiff twin compasses are two;<br>
Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show<br>
To move, but doth, if the other do.
</p><p>
And though it in the center sit,<br>
Yet when the other far doth roam,<br>
It leans and hearkens after it,<br>
And grows erect, as that comes home.
</p><p>
Such wilt thou be to me, who must,<br>
Like th' other foot, obliquely run;<br>
Thy firmness makes my circle just,<br>
And makes me end where I begun.
