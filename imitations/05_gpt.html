This is a word we use to plug<br>
holes with. It's the right size for those warm<br>
blanks in speech, for those red heart-<br>
shaped vacancies on the page that look nothing<br>
like real hearts. Add lace<br>
and you can sell<br>
it. We insert it also in the one empty<br>
space on the printed form<br>
that comes with no instructions. There are whole<br>
magazines with not much in them<br>
but the word love, you can<br>
rub it all over your body and you<br>
can cook with it too. How do we know<br>
it isn't what goes on at the cool<br>
debaucheries of slugs under damp<br>
pieces of cardboard? As for the weed-<br>
seedlings nosing their tough snouts up<br>
among the lettuces, they shout it.<br>
Love! Love! sing the soldiers, raising<br>
their glittering knives in salute.
</p><p>
Then there's the two<br>
of us. This word<br>
is far too short for us, it has only<br>
four letters, too sparse<br>
to fill those deep bare<br>
vacuums between the stars<br>
that press on us with their deafness.<br>
It's not love we don't wish<br>
to fall into, but that fear.<br>
this word is not enough but it will<br>
have to do. It's a single<br>
vowel in this metallic<br>
silence, a mouth that says<br>
O again and again in wonder<br>
and pain, a breath, a finger<br>
grip on a cliffside. You can<br>
hold on or let go.
