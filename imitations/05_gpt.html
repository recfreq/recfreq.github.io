This is a word we use to plug<br>
holes with. It's the right size for those warm<br>
blanks in speech, for those red heart-<br>
shaped vacancies on the page that look nothing<br>
like real hearts. Add lace<br>
and you can sell<br>
it. We insert it also in the one empty<br>
space on the printed form<br>
that comes with no instructions. There are whole<br>
magazines with not much in them<br>
but the word love, you can<br>
rub it all over your body and you<br>
can cook with it too. How do we know<br>
it isn't what goes on at the cool<br>
debaucheries of slugs under damp<br>
pieces of cardboard? As for the weed-<br>
seedlings nosing their tough snouts up<br>
among the lettuces, they shout it.<br>
Love! Love! sing the soldiers, raising<br>
their glittering knives in salute.
</p><p>
Then there's the two<br>
of us. This word<br>
is far too short for us, it has only<br>
four letters, too sparse<br>
to fill those deep bare<br>
vacuums between the stars<br>
that press on us with their deafness.<br>
It's not love we don't wish<br>
to fall into, but that fear.<br>
this word is not enough but it will<br>
have to do. It's a single<br>
vowel in this metallic<br>
silence, a mouth that says<br>
O again and again in wonder<br>
and pain, a breath, a finger<br>
grip on a cliffside. You can<br>
hold on or let go.

<b>This is a word we use to plug<br>

and you can sell<br>
it. We insert it also in a fake body<br>
and a touch of sexuality to a<br>
gel. It's the size of your hand<br>
and your imagination can do with<br>
lay copulation what text just said,<br>
rub it all over your body and you<br>
can cook with it too. How do we know<br>
it isn't part of the package<br>
that comes with the package? There are<br>
no spirits in them.<br>
Viruses, we see pouring from the walled<br>
bottoms of my father's small publishing<br>
business, he immerses himself<br>
in Victorian-era NY reading to his wide audience.

Then there's the two<br>
of us. This word<br>
is far too short for us, it has only<br>
four letters, too scant<br>
to follow the mnemonic<br>
light of day, but instead<br>
carry it, show along the radii<br>
Which control the afternoon by acting<br>
Like Liquor on a Metal Figure. It has<br>
four sides, three of which are Fire:<br>
(1) There is poetry in Blue<br>
And Gold, and a genius in you<br>
That knows how to set fire to<br>
Different things. (2) There is<br>
believe what you see, and<br>
What you believe, is incorrect.<br>
(3) And there is beauty in<br>
the reflection of binoculars.
