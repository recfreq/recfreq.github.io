I leave unseen, I leave with joy<br>
That electric fence neon-signed<br>
Barring your life against our toys,<br>
Twenty-one years of growing up cold;<br>
Thanks again for the show.
</p><p>
Mommy, I'll write you from prison,<br>
Locked up for taking pictures<br>
Of you stark naked in person;<br>
Twenty-one snaps too many to count,<br>
The papers were paying a hefty amount.
</p><p>
I thought I saw you on Rodeo drive,<br>
But alas my camera ain't good,<br>
So I caught you on TV while I fly<br>
In a lipstick commercial scantily clad,<br>
Looking very aristocrat.
</p><p>
You were out having some fun,<br>
When I thought of using a gun;<br>
Cock, stop, load, and trigger,<br>
The image of heaven the fire of hell.<br>
That shot was fucking LOUD.
</p><p>
Hollywood hills of cemetery doom,<br>
Where those movies are shown<br>
Every other Sunday afternoon,<br>
Of the mommy substitute teacher<br>
Who doesn't--like you--leave me alone.
</p><p>
You didn't want me in the front of the car;<br>
Cuz Marky Mark was driving you to rest in bed.<br>
Finis to <i>My Life as a Communist</i> premiere,<br>
So I took out my camera to get your sneer,<br>
But you didn't want me infront of the car.
</p><p>
Snap, snap of <i>A Star Is Born</i><br>
Or the new action thriller, you singing a song<br>
In a poster, live with Jimmy Kimmel,<br>
Waving to the crowd and Mr. Marky Mark.<br>
"No, no, not in the back of the car."
</p><p>
I sit on the curb side,<br>
Rejected but alive.<br>
No dinner, no food, a penthouse for a home,<br>
Gotta wait to see you in the DVD of<br>
<i>Kill Bill Volume Five</i>.
</p><p>
I have always adored you, my love,<br>
Your shiny earrings, your tiny stuff.<br>
<i>On the Town</i>, you in a tight Armani gown;<br>
<i>House Party</i>, you come and go in a frock.<br>
Your gaze gives off glitzy, glamorous, glimmering gleams.
</p><p>
They would <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> you<br>
To devour your flesh;<br>
You <i>Million Dollar Mermaid</i>, you,<br>
Stripped bare by her bachelors, even.<br>
They follow you, they copy you, they love you--so do I.
</p><p>
Untimely ripped from your womb I am,<br>
Born black from your white stomach,<br>
A third class citizen to Uncle Sam,<br>
Unwanted refuse ripe for cheap labor,<br>
While master Simon seduces my Emmeline.
</p><p>
One look at me, and you shudder,<br>
"What will I do with a yellow son?"<br>
A yellow girl would marry a white man,<br>
But a yellow man is just his biggest fan.<br>
Change we can believe in--yes we can!
</p><p>
No we can't, no we can't.<br>
No stopping the army of droid Coppelias<br>
Flowing over the red carpet<br>
The women come and go talking of the Oscars,<br>
And you at its head, standing away from us.
</p><p>
You sucked my life juice out like a lemon,<br>
Then tossed me away among the film scraps.<br>
"You're eighteen and yellow, time to go on alone."<br>
Back you go to your coterie from way back,<br>
But me your son, I'm not human.
</p><p>
You taught me not to say sorry,<br>
And join <i>it</i> like all else, not fight <i>it</i>.<br>
But me my pen can't help but write<br>
The review by a critic who has seen it,<br>
The one that destroys your career.
</p><p>
I know my lifegiver can't stand me,<br>
She's gone out of her way to feed me<br>
To the dogs, and conceive another son,<br>
One more like one of her own, a clone.<br>
Mommy you lying bitch goddess, leave me alone.
