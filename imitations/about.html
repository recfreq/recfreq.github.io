IMITATIONS OF IMMORTALITY
</p><p>
are two sets of variations in deep structure of<br>
classic poems of diverse forms and themes, written by<br>
RAY LC and by GPT-2, a machine-learning text generation model.
</p><p>
The human-written works draws inspiration from events in<br>
the author's own life, but written as variations on not only<br>
the meter and rhyme scheme and diction of each classic work,<br>
but deep variation on its semantics and purpose.
</p><p>
What is the extent of machine capabilities in writing deep<br>
emotional and purposive variations as humans do? I trained GTP-2<br>
on each of the 8 works, and fine-tuned each poem with my own<br>
variation to teach it to create variations by learning to variate.
