<div id="contents-2"><p>
Like forlorn lovers who must part,<br>
Eyes gazing on a fixed eye,<br>
To distance futures they take heart,<br>
As strangers they meet in the sky.
</p><p>
As ten long years have since elapsed,<br>
Two mismatched spirits they've become.<br>
Now parents with a childhood's past,<br>
They no longer can return home.
</p><p>
So you, my father, leaves me now,<br>
Through pains of hemorrhagic nail<br>
And constant dysentery bowel,<br>
You struggle on to leave a trail.
</p><p>
Silk soaked in oil is no more bright,<br>
It shows no shine, gains but luster.<br>
Scrub out hard pencil marks all night,<br>
Still leaves the paths of erasure.
</p><p>
Thus written past is set in stone,<br>
A ten year gap comes now, goes thence.<br>
Future is but the past begun,<br>
So what is death but ten years hence?
</p><p>
Like a pen tracing history,<br>
On a seismograph rotating on<br>
The Wheel of Life, a trajectory<br>
Never makes twice the same pattern.
</p><p>
You stirred thus back and forth, your Life<br>
Waning upon the bed, the street,<br>
Love lost to bitterness and strife,<br>
Fond remembrance of feat complete.
</p><p>
Cylinder spins as times pass by,<br>
From right and left movements derive<br>
A print of life, its low, its high.<br>
Forever new skylines arrive.
</p><p>
It writes over every ten years<br>
The track left by a previous self.<br>
Heartbreaks relived have lost their tears,<br>
Memories remain, feelings withheld.
</p><p>
The death that comes now, my father,<br>
Is an old trail from which you stray,<br>
Future of a child's past, before<br>
We died a little bit each day.
