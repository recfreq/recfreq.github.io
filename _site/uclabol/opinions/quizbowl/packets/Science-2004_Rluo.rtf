**). In mammals, it is accompanied by compaction, or formation of cadherins that enable maximum surface contact.  In arthropods, it is superficial, while radial, spiral, and rotational patterns are types of the holoblastic variety differentiated by orientation of mitotic spindles.  In fish, reptiles, and birds, this process is meroblastic, or incomplete, due to the prescence of yolk.  Forming a morula that later undergoes blastulation to form a blastocoel cavity and a blastula, FTP name this first stage of development after fertilization, a series of cell divisions.\par

**). The discovery of this enzyme began with studies of \i Tetrahymena thermophila\i0  and its intron-catalyzed splicing system.  Manfred Eigen added zinc to RNA molecules in a solution of monomers and found that long sequences of nucleotides were produced.  Later, ribonuclease P was found to be unnecessary for cutting pre-tRNA.  It is best associated with Thomas Cech of the University of Colorado, Boulder, who showed that RNA is autocatalytic, which led to speculation that life began with RNA as both genetic material and catalyst.
