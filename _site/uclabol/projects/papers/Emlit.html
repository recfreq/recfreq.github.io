  <P>October 2
   <UL>
    <LI>Noted some objectives for present and future development 
        (eg. December / January).</LI>
    <LI>Objective 1: Separate the low level robotic control from the
	basic GUI and simulation framework, so that others can use the 
	code for their own robot platforms.  That is, abstract the
	notion of physical robotic experimentation into a separate 
	component in the code (or control in the GUI).</LI>
    <LI>Objective 2: Write some fast C code (openGL) for the graphics
        portion of the MazeFrame so we can show more than a two
	dimensional overview of the robot.  Envision using 3D graphics 
	to represent the robot and maze during simulation.  May also 
	make this the primary frame, ie flatten the GUI so that we 
	are keeping track of statistics and camera movement in 
	secondary windows.</LI>
    <LI>Objective 3: Do some user task analysis for the interface,
	including, but not limited to, task scenarios and evaluation
	using heuristics.</LI>
    <LI>Objective 4: Most importantly, get the simulation working, at
        least at a crude level.  Compare the algorithms and do some 
	algorithmic analysis before incorporating machine learning.
	Thus another reason to modulized the robot/GUI code better.</LI>
   </UL></P>

  <P>August 21
   <UL>
    <LI>All documentation have been converted to html format.</LI>
    <LI>Need a simple, possibly non-GUI application that uses and tests
	only the QLearning* classes (~ 2 days).</LI>
    <LI>JNI code needs to be changed for the PC platform (~ 3 - 4 days).</LI>
   </UL></P>

  <P>August 11
   <UL>
    <LI>ExplorerFrame and MazeFrame are basically complete.</LI>
    <LI>StatusFrame is not complete, but the source of the data 
        has already been incorporated, so the fix should not be too
	time-consuming (~ 3 - 5 hrs).</LI>
    <LI>Four neighbor drawing code has been fixed; works fine now
        for LineRobot.  However, CamRobot drawing code is buggy
	for eight neighbors (~ 2 hrs). </LI>
    <LI>Readme dialog won't link hyperlinks correctly (~ 3 hrs).</LI>
    <LI>About dialog is empty, but is very simple to implement
	(~ 20 minutes).</LI>
    <LI>Communication in the InterfaceFrame is not finished; in
        particular, we need an ExperimentManager that tells the 
	QLearningExperiment to do things and communicates the info
	to the frames (~ 3 days). </LI>
    <LI>Open and save utilities not implemented; need a file format
        and some file stream code in the listener for the open
	and save buttons (~ 4 - 5 days). </LI>
    <LI>Camera.c won't compile, due to Java glue and IMA (~
        forever).</LI>

   <A NAME = "RUN">Running the Interface Program</A>
  </H3>

  <P>Native code is implemented for the Unix system at the 
     <A HREF = "http://vislab.ucr.edu">UCR Visualization and Intelligent
     Systems Laboratory</A>.  Namely, CamRobot.c, LineRobot.c, Camera.c, and
     HandyBoard.c are for use specifically with the IMA imaging system and the MIT
     <A HREF = "http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board">
     Handy Board</A>.  To use the code for a different platform, simply change
     the specific references to these classes in the Status, Explorer, and 
     Maze frames, or add your implementation as an option.  See 
     <A HREF = "#PROG">Program Structure</A> for details.</P>

  <P>All files are in the ucr_reu directory (corresponding to the
     ucr_reu package).  The java-specific paths must be set as follows:
     CLASSPATH set to the directory containing ucr_reu, LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     set to ucr_reu itself.</P>

  <P>To recompile the project, do the following:
     <OL>
      <LI>Make sure the CamRobot.java file static block loads the "CamRobot"
          library.</LI>
      <LI>Compile the java files using <CODE>javac *.java</CODE>, with 
	  the -classpath option set to the directory containing ucr_reu.</LI>
      <LI>Create a header file for CamRobot.java using <CODE>javah -jni
	  CamRobot</CODE>.
	  You must also reset the CLASSPATH (or use the -classpath option)
	  to ucr_reu so that javah can find CamRobot.java.</LI>
      <LI>Make sure your C implementation file meets the requirements of 
          the header file (same function declarations).</LI>
      <LI>Invoke the C compiler, creating the shared library in the process
          using <CODE>cc -G -I/usr/java/include -I/usr/java/include/solaris 
 	  CamRobot.c -o libCamRobot.so</CODE>, assuming your java directory is
	  located in usr (as in sevenup).  For shasta, use: <CODE>cc -G 
	  -I/usr/local/inst/jdk1.2.2/include
	  -I/usr/local/inst/jdk1.2.2/include/solaris CamRobot.c -o 
	  libCamRobot.so
	  </CODE></LI>
      <LI>Repeat procedure for LineRobot and Camera classes.</LI>
     </OL></P>

  <P>To run the program, use <CODE>java ucr_reu/InterfaceFrame</CODE>, 
     with -classpath set to the directory containing ucr_reu; or simply
     <CODE>java InterfaceFrame</CODE> (unset your CLASSPATH).</P>

   <A NAME = "TASK">Robot Learning Task</A>
  </H3>

  <P>Given starting coordinates and a starting orientation, the task 
     of the robot is to search for the goal coordinate of an arbitrary
     maze possibly filled with obstacles.  When the goal is found,
     the robot is replaced at the starting coordinates and the next
     trial (or episode) of the search takes place.  The robot and the
     corresponding search algorithm has no knowledge of the goal
     coordinates in all trials.  They also have initial knowledge of the
     environment.  As the number of episodes increases, the
     performance of the robot, as measured by total number of moves 
     taken to reach the goal, should improve.</P>

  <P>Although mazes and algorithms of various shapes and types can be
     used for this experiment, we chose to implement only 4 and 8
     neighbor q learning on a rectangular maze.  The interface is
     flexible enough, however to allow for mazes of different types
     (one only has to implement a specific maze class that extends the
     abstract Maze class).  Similarly, different types of algorithms
     can be created (one needs to make small changes to
     NewExperimentDialog, implement an option panel for the new
     algorithm specifying the user input parameters, a custum Maze or
     RectMaze class that keeps track of state information, and an
     Experiment class which takes a subclass of Robot and a subclass
     of Maze among its arguments and generates specific actions by
     calling the robot and updating the maze).</P>

  <P>An algorithmic implementation necessitates an implementation of
     the abstract Robot class.  Currently, the two direct subclasses
     of Robot are LineRobot and CamRobot.  LineRobot controls the line-
     sensing robot from the 1999 NSF UCR REU robotics project.  See
     <A HREF = "http://vislab.ucr.edu/~pat">last year's
     documentation</A> for more details.  CamRobot controls the
     NSF UCR REU robot.  It has a mounted camera, four proximity
     sensors, stepper motors, servo motors for rotating and tilting
     the camera, encoders for fine position control, and bump sensors.
     When a new robot is built, we need to construct a new subclass
     of Robot.  We also need to add a specific case for the code in
     the ExplorerFrame and possibly the initialization dialogs.</P>

  <P>This year's focuses on the use of a mounted camera to detect and
     avoid obstacles.  To improve performance, the camera communicates
     directly with the computer, which sends signals to the Handy Board
     on the robot, telling it to check sensors, move forward, rotate,
     etc.  The robot also has error checking capabilities associated
     with movement (encoders) and emergencies (bump sensors).  We
     hope to demonstrate improved performance, as measured by the 
     number of actions taken to reach the goal state in a maze, in a
     real-time robotic system.</P>

  <P>The following is a list of classes for the project, along with
     specifications, their super class, and links to their present
     source code.  (You can freely access the html source and compile 
     the classes directly after removing the first and last lines of 
     the file.  Note that package statements have been omitted from
     the source to allow easy access.).

  <P>In addition to these classes, the project contains the interface 
     <A HREF = "source_html/InterfaceConstants.java.html">InterfaceConstants</A>, 
     for the Reinforcement Learning Robotic Interface package.  
     It contains all the programmer-specified constants for the 
     package, including 
     <OL>
      <LI>interface modes</LI>
      <LI>required bounds (in pixels) of frames and graphic components</LI>
      <LI>colors, borders and other GUI specifications</LI>
      <LI>default start-up values for robots and mazes</LI>
      <LI>strings for image files and hyperlinks</LI>  
     </OL>
     Every concrete class in the package implements InterfaceConstants.
     The three abstract classes: Robot, Experiment, and Maze can be used in
     other projects, perhaps as extensions.  They are the core classes to extend
     for expanding the capabilities of the Reinforcement Robotic Interface.</P>

  <P>Note that some classes are implemented by native code in conjunction with
     the <A HREF = "http://java.sun.com/products//jdk/1.2/docs/guide/jni/index.html">
     Java Native Interface</A>.</P>

  <P>All robot code is written in Interactive C, for the MIT Handy Board.
     <A HREF = "source_html/HandyBoard.c.html">HandyBoard.c</A> is the implementation
     of receiver/transmitter communication from the Handy Board's side.
     Note that motor and sensor code have not been added.  A possible way to 
     control the stepper motor using software is presented in 
     <A HREF = "source_html/StepperMotor.c.html">StepperMotor.c</A>, which was found
     in Peter Harrison's 
     <A HREF = "http://www.cctc.demon.co.uk/stepper.htm">web site</A>.
     The computer/board communication has been tested; optimizations for speed, 
     however, have not yet been made.  We hope to increase the baud rate for 
     the communication for CamRobot and decrease the delay time on the computer's
     side.  A version of the code for the LineRobot is working.  Specifically, we
     can command the old line robot directly and show its status and position
     in the Interface Frame.</P>

           An implementation of Experiment for used in a 4 or 8 neighbor 
           Q Learning reinforcement experiment or simulation.  It 
           controls the flow of the experiment by calling its Robot 
           object to perform actions and updating the q values via 
           its QLearningRectMaze object.  Specifically, the action 
           taken during each robot state is randomly selected with
           respect to the q values for each possible action:
	   <P>
           P(ai | s) = (k ^ Q(s, ai)) / (sum over j (k ^ Q(s, aj)))

           where the probability of taking the action ai at state s 
           is calculated from the user-specified exploitation factor k 
           greater than 0, and the q values for each action at state s. 
           As k increases, the equation favors actions with high q 
           values more and more.  Note that when k = 1 or when 
           Q(s, ai) = 0 for all ai, the calculated probability for
