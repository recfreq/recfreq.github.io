<div id="contents-2"><p></p>
Like forlorn lovers who must part,<br>
<div class="orig">Eyes gazing on a fixed eye,</div>
<div class="ref">Eyes gazing on a fixed eye,</div><br>
To distance futures they take heart,<br>
As strangers they meet in the sky.
<p></p>
As ten long years have since elapsed,<br>
<div class="orig">Two mismatched spirits they've become.</div>
<div class="ref">Two mismatched spirits they've become.</div><br>
Now parents with a childhood's past,<br>
They no longer can return home.
<p></p>
So you, my father, leaves me now,<br>
<div class="orig">Through pains of hemorrhagic nail</div>
<div class="ref">Through pains of hemorrhagic nail</div><br>
And constant dysentery bowel,<br>
You struggle on to leave a trail.
<p></p>
Silk soaked in oil is no more bright,<br>
<div class="orig">It shows no shine, gains but luster.</div>
<div class="ref">It shows no shine, gains but luster.</div><br>
Scrub out hard pencil marks all night,<br>
Still leaves the paths of erasure.
<p></p>
Thus written past is set in stone,<br>
<div class="orig">A ten year gap comes now, goes thence.</div>
<div class="ref">A ten year gap comes now, goes thence.</div><br>
Future is but the past begun,<br>
So what is death but ten years hence?
<p></p>
Like a pen tracing history,<br>
<div class="orig">On a seismograph rotating on</div>
<div class="ref">On a seismograph rotating on</div><br>
The Wheel of Life, a trajectory<br>
Never makes twice the same pattern.
<p></p>
You stirred thus back and forth, your Life<br>
<div class="orig">Waning upon the bed, the street,</div>
<div class="ref">Waning upon the bed, the street,</div><br>
Love lost to bitterness and strife,<br>
Fond remembrance of feat complete.
<p></p>
Cylinder spins as times pass by,<br>
<div class="orig">From right and left movements derive</div>
<div class="ref">From right and left movements derive</div><br>
A print of life, its low, its high.<br>
Forever new skylines arrive.
<p></p>
It writes over every ten years<br>
<div class="orig">The track left by a previous self.</div>
<div class="ref">The track left by a previous self.</div><br>
Heartbreaks relived have lost their tears,<br>
Memories remain, feelings withheld.
<p></p>
The death that comes now, my father,<br>
<div class="orig">Is an old trail from which you stray,</div>
<div class="ref">Is an old trail from which you stray,</div><br>
Future of a child's past, before<br>
<div class="fader">We died a little bit each day.</div>
