I<br>
Among twenty snowy mountains,<br>
The only moving thing<br>
Was the eye of the blackbird.
</p><p>
II<br>
I was of three minds,<br>
Like a tree<br>
In which there are three blackbirds.
</p><p>
III<br>
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.<br>
It was a small part of the pantomime.
</p><p>
IV<br>
A man and a woman<br>
Are one.<br>
A man and a woman and a blackbird<br>
Are one.
</p><p>
V<br>
I do not know which to prefer,<br>
The beauty of inflections<br>
Or the beauty of innuendoes,<br>
The blackbird whistling<br>
Or just after.
</p><p>
VI<br>
Icicles filled the long window<br>
With barbaric glass.<br>
The shadow of the blackbird<br>
Crossed it, to and fro.<br>
The mood<br>
Traced in the shadow<br>
An indecipherable cause.
</p><p>
VII<br>
O thin men of Haddam,<br>
Why do you imagine golden birds?<br>
Do you not see how the blackbird<br>
Walks around the feet<br>
Of the women about you?
</p><p>
VIII<br>
I know noble accents<br>
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;<br>
But I know, too,<br>
That the blackbird is involved<br>
In what I know.
</p><p>
IX<br>
When the blackbird flew out of sight,<br>
It marked the edge<br>
Of one of many circles.
</p><p>
X<br>
At the sight of blackbirds<br>
Flying in a green light,<br>
Even the bawds of euphony<br>
Would cry out sharply.
</p><p>
XI<br>
He rode over Connecticut<br>
In a glass coach.<br>
Once, a fear pierced him,<br>
In that he mistook<br>
The shadow of his equipage<br>
For blackbirds.
</p><p>
XII<br>
The river is moving.<br>
The blackbird must be flying.
</p><p>
XIII<br>
It was evening all afternoon.<br>
It was snowing<br>
And it was going to snow.<br>
The blackbird sat<br>
In the cedar-limbs.

<b>I<br>
Among twenty snowy mountains,<br>
The only moving thing<br>
Was the eye of the blackbird.</b>
</p><p>
II<br>
I was of three minds,<br>
Like crystal ball<br>
Both good and bad,
</p><p>
III<br>
The blackbird continued to listen to me say,<br>
No explanation is certain.
</p><p>
IV<br>
A man and a woman and a blackbird<br>
Are one.<br>
A man and a blackbird and a man<br>
Are two.
</p><p>
V<br>
I do not know the name of the town<br>
But I know Italy.<br>
The towns were moved when I was nearing the end<br>
And the poor were not continued to light machinery.<br>
The people began to talk.
</p><p>
VI<br>
Icicles filled the long window<br>
With barbaric blue.<br>
The shadow of the heavy wooden<br>
crossings. Cover.<br>
The blackbird flew.<br>
The spiral bars<br>
In which the blackbird hangs.
</p><p>
VII<br>
O thin men of Haddam,<br>
Why do you imagine golden hairs?<br>
In a woman's left hand and a man's right<br>
Scraped flat by the roller<br>
of the body count?
</p><p>
VIII<br>
The blackbird is smart enough not to see<br>
the brilliant prism<br>
Underfoot that casts her exhibition.<br>
A blackbird is a man if he is a woman<br>
But a cat is just a cat.
</p><p>
IX<br>
When the blackbird flew,<br>
It marked the border<br>
Of sex and women.
</p><p>
X<br>
I have a mental image,<br>
Like a white board,<br>
The identity of the blackbird with the piece<br>
Of meat with the 'light'
</p><p>
XI<br>
O thin men of Connecticut<br>
who must be infatuated<br>
With their eyes,<br>
they see They pass them by<br>
Like lots celebrating estradomena felicitas.<br>
It was time for anthropomorphic blackbirds.
</p><p>
XII<br>
It sat in the backyard,<br>
Like a box that needs getting.
</p><p>
XIII<br>
The blackbird is my judo piece,<br>
my bone, my thumb. It is my cause<br>
to victory and infamy and suffering,<br>
red between Heaven and Earth, a<br>
book in a box.
