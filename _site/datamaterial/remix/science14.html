The science of forgetting is not inscrutable;</div>
so much information pokes at our brain</div>
for attention that to forget it is forgivable.</div><br>

Making forgetting a routine is an insightful</div>
way to absorb rejection and deal with pain.</div>
The science of forgetting is not inscrutable.</div><br>

Forget old colleagues' names that aren't so useful;</div>
omit trained habits to learn new ones instead.</div>
Just archive your indices. Tis all forgivable.</div><p>


<div class="line1">I can forget meetings, failures, disputes; capable<br>
<div class="line2">of conditioning my mind daily to remain sane.<br>
<div class="line3">The science of forgetting is not inscrutable.<br><br>

<div class="line4">I blank out on my age, name, and every syllable<br>
<div class="line5">I uttered (Emphatic!) to make my existence remain.<br>
<div class="line6">It moved on before me, but even that's forgivable.<br><br>

<div class="line7">But when you (whose voice moves me, face bespectacle)<br>
<div class="line8">left me my memories, I give but one refrain:<br>
<div class="line9">the science of forgetting is not inscrutable<br>
but being forgotten, that is unforgivable.
